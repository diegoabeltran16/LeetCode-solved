# üìù Problem 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists

## **Problem Description**

Given the heads of two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`, merge them into one sorted linked list. The list should be made by splicing together nodes of the first two lists without creating new nodes.

### **Merge Rules**

* Both input lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
* The merged linked list should reuse existing nodes.
* Maintain the sorted order during merging.

---

## **Examples**

| Input                | Output          | Explanation                  |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `[1,2,4]`, `[1,3,4]` | `[1,1,2,3,4,4]` | Nodes merged in sorted order |
| `[]`, `[]`           | `[]`            | Both lists empty             |
| `[]`, `[0]`          | `[0]`           | One list empty               |

---

## **Constraints**

* Number of nodes in both lists: `[0, 50]`
* Node values: `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* Lists sorted in non-decreasing order.

---

## **Input**

* Heads of two singly-linked lists (`list1`, `list2`).

## **Output**

* Head of the merged sorted linked list.

---

## **Why is this problem important?**

* Fundamental problem for understanding linked list manipulation.
* Essential for mastering merge operations in algorithms like Merge Sort.
* Real-world analogy: **Merging sorted data streams efficiently**.

# üöÇ **The Great Train Merge: The Conductor‚Äôs Tale**

In **Dataville Central Station**, three legendary conductors prepared their trains to merge on the **Merge Track**:

* **üêç Python Express** led by the **Cautious Conductor**, carefully choosing every next passenger.
* **ü¶´ Go Sprinter** under the **Nimble Conductor**, merging carriages with impressive speed.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Rust Bullet**, driven by the **Fearless Conductor**, merging carriages precisely and swiftly.

The passengers arrived safely, quickly, and efficiently, thanks to their conductor‚Äôs careful choices, nimble reflexes, and fearless precision.

Each conductor used their skills wisely, ensuring **Dataville** remained the fastest, safest, and most efficient rail hub.
