# üìù Problem 14. Longest Common Prefix

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Strings, Arrays

---

## üìñ Problem Statement

Write a function to find the **longest common prefix string** amongst an array of strings.

If there is **no common prefix**, return an **empty string `""`**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples**

#### **Example 1**

**Input:**  
`strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`

**Output:**  
`"fl"`

---

#### **Example 2**

**Input:**  
`strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`

**Output:**  
`""`

**Explanation:**  
There is no common prefix among the input strings.

---

### üîí **Constraints**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` consists of only **lowercase English letters** if it is non-empty.

---

## üí° **Key insights**

- The longest common prefix must be a **prefix of the first word**.
- Comparing character by character is efficient to avoid unnecessary substring creation.
- If any string is empty, the result is automatically `""`.

---

### ‚ú® **Why is this problem important?**

‚úÖ Trains **string manipulation fundamentals**  
‚úÖ Builds intuition for **early stopping conditions** in scanning algorithms  
‚úÖ Real-world applications:
  - Autocomplete systems
  - Command parsers
  - DNA sequence alignment (prefix similarity)

## üîç **Key Insights**

‚úÖ **Rust leads** with minimal memory and fastest runtime, ideal for system-level optimizations.

‚úÖ **Go and C** deliver optimal speed with low memory use and simplicity.

‚úÖ **C++, Java, and C#** perform efficiently but come with higher runtime memory footprints due to their managed runtimes or language abstractions.

‚úÖ **JavaScript** remains surprisingly performant but with **very high memory usage** due to the V8 engine.

‚úÖ **Python is readable and elegant**, but interpreted performance remains a limitation for large-scale high-frequency calls.
